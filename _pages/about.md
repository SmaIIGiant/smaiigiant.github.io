### Biography

I just received my Computer Science degree from University of Michigan, and I am currently working as an **Undergraduate Research Assistant** at the [Zoetic Robotics Lab](https://www.zoeticrobotics.com/) in the **University of Michigan**, supervised by **Dr. Cameron Aubin**. 

My research focuses on **bio-inspired, micro-scale and soft robotics**. At Michigan, I have worked on several projects, including the development of **amphibious screw-propelled micro-robots** and **suction cups with active delamination and energy-harvesting mechanisms**. Our work on suction cup control, *“Release Chamber Enables Suction Cup to Delaminate and Harvest Fluid,”* was recognized as a **Best Student Paper Finalist** and received the **Best Paper Award in Benchmarking and Reproducibility** at the **2025 IEEE International Conference on Soft Robotics (RoboSoft)**.

I am also a **co-first author** on the upcoming paper *“Field-Effect Elastocapillary Actuators,”* which explores novel muscle-like actuators based on field-effect elastocapillary interactions.

Before joining Michigan, I studied **Biological Engineering** at **Pennsylvania State University**, where I was a member of the **Schreyer Honors College**. My interdisciplinary background in biology and engineering shapes how I approach robotics—integrating biological principles with mechanical design to create more adaptive and efficient systems.
