### Biography

I recently graduated with a **B.S.E in Computer Science** from the **University of Michigan**, where I now work as an **Undergraduate Research Assistant** at the [Zoetic Robotics Lab](https://www.zoeticrobotics.com/), supervised by **Dr. Cameron Aubin**. 

My research focuses on **bio-inspired, micro-scale and soft robotics**. At Michigan, I have worked on several projects, including the development of **amphibious screw-propelled micro-robots** and **suction cups with active delamination and energy-harvesting mechanisms**. Our work on suction cup control, *“Release Chamber Enables Suction Cup to Delaminate and Harvest Fluid,”* was recognized as a **Best Student Paper Finalist** and received the **Best Paper Award in Benchmarking and Reproducibility** at the **2025 IEEE International Conference on Soft Robotics (RoboSoft)**.

I am also a **co-first author** on the upcoming paper *“Field-Effect Elastocapillary Actuators,”* which explores novel muscle-like actuators based on field-effect elastocapillary interactions.
